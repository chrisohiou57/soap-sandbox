# Overview
This application is a SOAP API Gateway in our multi-module banking demo project. It is implemented using [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) and its component libraries. Here is a good excerpt from the book <i>Microservices for [Java Developers, 2nd Edition by Rafael Benevides, Christian Posta](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/microservices-for-java/9781492038290/)</i> that describes why an application such as this is beneficial.

> As the number of microservices grows, the complexity for the client who is consuming these APIs also grows.
> 
> Real applications could have dozens or even hundreds of microservices. A simple process like buying a book from an online store like Amazon can cause a client (your web browser or your mobile app) to use several other microservices. A client that has direct access to the microservice would have to locate and invoke them and handle any failures they caused itself. So, usually a better approach is to hide those services behind a new service layer. This aggregator service layer is known as an API gateway.
> 
> Another advantage of using an API gateway is that you can add cross-cutting concerns like authorization and data transformation in this layer. Services that use non-internet-friendly protocols can also benefit from the usage of an API gateway. However, keep in mind that it usually isnâ€™t recommended to have a single API gateway for all the microservices in your application. If you (wrongly) decided to take that approach, it would act just like a monolithic bus, violating microservice independence by coupling all the microservices. Adding business logic to an API gateway is a mistake and should be avoided.

# Features
The primary features implemented in this SOAP API Gateway implementation are described below.

## SOAP Proxy
CXF proxies are implemented for the downstream [retail and investment account SOAP APIs](https://github.com/chrisohiou57/soap-sandbox/tree/main/spring-boot-camel-soap-cxf/account-soap-service) which allows us to bind them to Camel routes.

## Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs)
One of the benefits that we get by binding our SOAP proxies to Camel routes is that it gives us the ability to implement [EIPs](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/index.html) around them. Apache Camel [supports](https://camel.apache.org/components/3.13.x/eips/enterprise-integration-patterns.html) most of the EIPs, and a few have been used in this application.

- [Multicast](https://camel.apache.org/components/3.13.x/eips/multicast-eip.html) - The `AccountRetrievalRoute` executes parallel remote SOAP API calls to the retail and investment services to get account details. The results are aggregated and the combined result is returned to the client.
- [OnCompletion](cuisinart) - The `AccountCreationRoute` executes a remote SOAP API call to the retail or investment SOAP API, depending on the account type in the request, to create a new account. When the remote downstream API call succeeds the route emits a message to a messaging broker via JMS. If the downstream API call fails the message is not emitted.

## WS-Security
The cross cutting WS-Security concern is implemented and terminated in the Gateway. WS-Security is not implemented in the downstream SOAP APIs.
